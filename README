Readme for the Greenhouse project
The Greenhouse project consists of a raspberry pi device which has two sensors.
One sensor is for temperature, the other for pressure.
At a later stage we will add humidity.

The Pi polls the sensors every minute and transmits the data to the Cloud.
The Cloud service used is ThingSpeak.
The advantage here is that the data can be accessed cleanly from any PC, tablet or mobile Phone.

Development work is needed to work out how to add more sensors.
